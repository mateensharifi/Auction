Can it be converted or not?
Compromise of stuff the can't be converted?
Name methods and say what they take, and what they spit out.
New variable --> not a string (actual object) called address which corresponds to single user.
Anything dealing with time --> not on the block, but block.

Pick a block time (15 min per block)
If happens in an hour --> it will take 4 blocks
