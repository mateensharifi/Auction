This Method from the UserSearch class seems complex:

Search(UserSearch, Filter) --> sorts the auctions
			- Time: 1 Block
      
      
      
I would break it into a first method that grabbed the set of posted auctions on the website --
(where the 'posted' parameter == 1)

grabLiveAuc ();

And a second method which sorted those auctions using quicksort by whatever auction parameter
inputed (low to high)

sort(filter);
